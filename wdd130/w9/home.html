         <p>Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience
         Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. Rafting is also a competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating nations. The International Rafting Federation, often referred to as the IRF, is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport   </p>

        <h2>Some Information</h2>
        <p>It is an activity to enjoy nature while having fun and playing sports. It is not more dangerous, as long as you choose a route that suits your possibilities, follow the basic instructions of the monitors responsible for the activity and do not "come up".

            It is not necessary to be in excellent physical shape or have specific equipment. If you feel like trying a different and exciting experience, many companies organize group descents down some of the Spanish rivers that have beautiful landscapes that would be difficult to discover otherwise.
            
            From descents of mighty rapids for the most daring, to quiet walks with some more “happy” section… there are many options to have a good time, while you discover, more closely than ever, the biodiversity hidden in some of our rivers.</p>
